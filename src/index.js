/*
  TO DO LIST:

  Change the way coordinates work from an array [x, y] to something more readable.
    # Maybe an object with x and y property

  Add the notifation that calls out that the ship was or was nor succesfully placed.
    # We have tests for that. Might add an object to log things though.

  Fix legalMoves functions to make a legalMoves based on the ship length
    and the state of the board.
    # Next on the menu
